# Typhon

Typhon is a Nix-based continuous integration software inspired by [Hydra](https://nixos.org/hydra).

## Prerequisites

This book assumes that you are familiar with Nix and Nix flakes. Being familiar
with Hydra is not necessary.

## Disclaimer

Typhon is still in early development and is merely a proof of concept. A lot of
core features are still missing and it is full of bugs. Please do not use it for
any serious purpose.
